    # FieldMatcher is responsible for extracting a value from a record
    # using a field (or index) and then delegating the match to LiteralMatcher logic.
    #
    # It handles nested access in structures like Hashes or Arrays, and guards
    # against types that should not be dig into (e.g., String, Symbol, Proc).
    #
    # This matcher is typically used when the query refers to a specific field,
    # like `{ age: { :$gte => 18 } }` where `:age` is passed as the dig field.
    #
    # @example
    #   matcher = FieldMatcher.build(:age, { :$gte => 18 })
    #   matcher.match?({ age: 20 }) #=> true
    #
    # @see LiteralMatcher
    class FieldMatcher < LiteralMatcher
      # A list of classes that should never be used for value digging.
      # These typically respond to `#[]` but are semantically invalid for this context.

        ::String,
        ::Integer,

      # Initializes the matcher with a target field and condition.
      #
      # @param field [Object] the field (or index) used to dig into the record
      # @param condition [Object] the condition to match against the extracted value

      # Performs field-based matching against the given record.
      #
      # This method first ensures the record is structurally eligible for field extractionâ€”
      # it must be a Hash, Array, or respond to `[]`. If the structure does not allow for
      # field access (e.g., nil, primitive values, or unsupported types), the match returns false.
      #
      # The field value is then extracted using the following rules:
      # - If the record is a Hash, it attempts to fetch using the field key,
      #   falling back to symbolized key if needed.
      # - If the record is an Array, it fetches by index.
      # - If the record does not support `[]` or is disallowed for dig operations,
      #   the match returns false immediately.
      #
      # Once the value is extracted, it is passed through the data converter
      # and matched against the condition via the superclass.
      #
      # @param record [Object] the input data structure to be matched
      # @return [Boolean] true if the extracted field value matches the condition; false otherwise
      #
      # @example Matching a Hash with a nil field value
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(a: nil)
      #   matcher.match?({ a: nil }) # => true
      #
      # @example Record is nil (structure not diggable)
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(a: nil)
      #   matcher.match?(nil) # => false
      #
      # @example Matching against an Array by index
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(0 => /abc/)
      #   matcher.match?(['abcdef']) # => true
      #
      # @example Hash with symbol key, matcher uses string key
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new('a' => 123)
      #   matcher.match?({ a: 123 }) # => true
