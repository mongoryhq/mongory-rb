    # FieldMatcher handles field-level matching by extracting and comparing field values.
    #
    # This matcher is responsible for:
    # 1. Extracting field values from records using dot notation
    # 2. Converting extracted values if needed
    # 3. Delegating the actual comparison to a submatcher
    #
    # It supports:
    # - Hash records with string/symbol keys
    # - Array records with numeric indices
    # - Objects that respond to `[]`
    #
    # @example Basic field matching
    #   matcher = FieldMatcher.build('age', 30)
    #   matcher.match?({ 'age' => 30 })  #=> true
    #   matcher.match?({ age: 30 })      #=> true
    #
    # @see LiteralMatcher
    class FieldMatcher < LiteralMatcher
      # A list of classes that should never be used for value digging.
      # These typically respond to `#[]` but are semantically invalid for this context.

      # Initializes a new field matcher.
      #
      # @param field [String, Symbol] the field to match against
      # @param condition [Object] the condition to match with
      # @param context [Context] the query context
      def initialize(field, condition, context: Context.new)

        super(condition, context: context)
      end

      # Creates a raw Proc that performs the field matching operation.
      # The Proc extracts the field value and delegates to the submatcher.
      #
      # This method first ensures the record is structurally eligible for field extractionâ€”
      # it must be a Hash, Array, or respond to `[]`. If the structure does not allow for
      # field access (e.g., nil, primitive values, or unsupported types), the match returns false.
      #
      # The field value is then extracted using the following rules:
      # - If the record is a Hash, it attempts to fetch using the field key,
      #   falling back to symbolized key if needed.
      # - If the record is an Array, it fetches by index.
      # - If the record does not support `[]` or is disallowed for dig operations,
      #   the match returns false immediately.
      #
      # Once the value is extracted, it is passed through the data converter
      # and matched against the condition via the superclass.
      #
      # @example Matching a Hash with a nil field value
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(a: nil)
      #   matcher.match?({ a: nil }) # => true
      #
      # @example Record is nil (structure not diggable)
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(a: nil)
      #   matcher.match?(nil) # => false
      #
      # @example Matching against an Array by index
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new(0 => /abc/)
      #   matcher.match?(['abcdef']) # => true
      #
      # @example Hash with symbol key, matcher uses string key
      #   matcher = Mongory::QueryMatcher.new('a' => 123)
      #   matcher.match?({ a: 123 }) # => true

      # Creates a raw Proc that performs the field-based matching operation.
      # The Proc extracts the field value and delegates matching to the superclass.
